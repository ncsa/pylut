# pylut
Python Lustre Tools

A collection of functions to simplify interaction with the
Lustre filesystem from Python.

NOTES:
+ The following environment variables are expected to be set:
  - PYLUTRSYNCPATH    ( path to rsync )
  - PYLUTLFSPATH      ( path to lfs )
  - PYLUTMAXRSYNCSIZE ( max filesize in bytes to transfer with rsync       )
                      ( files larger than PYLUTMAXRSYNCSIZE will be copied )
                      ( instead with dd before rsync is invoked            )

+ To run the Python tests, the 'testbases' dictionary elements must be updated
  with the local file system mountpoint(s) and test paths.
